# JavaFXDemo
(Just a simple quick demo for Part II students)

# Download, Build and Run
Clone or download this repository.  Open up IntelliJ and click File -> Open (or "Open File").
Select the build.gradle file, to open this.  When asked if you want to open as a project
or open as a file, select the option which opens it as a project.

Gradle will then automatically set things up.  Allow this to happen and then run the main method
in BigPicture.java.

The UML is also available in this repo (javafx.pdf)
